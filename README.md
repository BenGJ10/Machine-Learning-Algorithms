# Complete Machine Learning Bootcamp

## Overview
This repository contains practical notebooks from the **Complete Machine Learning Bootcamp by [Krish Naik](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCNU_lfiiWBdtULKOw6X0Dig)**.  
Each section dives into a core machine learning concept or algorithm, combining theory with hands-on implementation using real-world datasets.

## Contents

- [**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**](./Exploratory%20Data%20Analysis)  
  The first step in any ML project â€” explore datasets, uncover patterns, detect outliers, handle missing values, and visualize distributions to build intuition before modeling.  
  *Dataset: Google Playstore, Flight Price*

- [**Feature Engineering**](./Feature%20Engineering)  
  Enhance model performance by crafting meaningful input features. Learn feature scaling, encoding categorical variables, binning, and selecting relevant attributes.

- [**Linear Regression**](./Linear%20Regression)  
  A basic yet powerful algorithm for predicting continuous outcomes by modeling the linear relationship between independent variables and the target.  
  *Dataset: Height-Weights, Economical Index*

- [**Ridge and Lasso Regression**](./Ridge%20Lasso%20Regression)  
  Extensions of linear regression that include regularization to avoid overfitting. Ridge (L2) and Lasso (L1) add penalty terms to control model complexity and multicollinearity.  
  *Dataset: Algerian Forest Fires*

- [**Logistic Regression**](./Logistic%20Regression)  
  A classification algorithm that predicts the probability of a binary outcome using a logistic (sigmoid) function. Commonly used for tasks like spam detection or medical diagnosis.

- [**K Means Clustering**](./K%20Means%20Clustering)  
  An unsupervised learning algorithm that partitions data into K distinct clusters based on similarity. Widely used for customer segmentation, image compression, and pattern discovery.

- [**Decision Trees**](./Decision%20Trees)  
  A tree-structured model used for both classification and regression. It splits data based on feature values to form interpretable "if-else" rules.

- [**Random Forest**](./Random%20Forest)  
  An ensemble of decision trees that reduces variance and boosts accuracy. It works by averaging or voting across multiple trees trained on different data subsets.

- [**Support Vector Machines (SVMs)**](./Support%20Vector%20Machines)  
  A powerful classifier that finds the optimal boundary (hyperplane) between classes. Effective in high-dimensional spaces and often used in text and image classification.

- [**Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**](./Principal%20Component%20Analysis)  
  A technique to reduce the number of features while retaining the most important information. PCA transforms correlated variables into a smaller set of uncorrelated components.
